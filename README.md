# Modular Madness

To compile the code go to repo location and execute `make` command

The code will be placed in the `bin` directory. Then do `cd` to `bin`, then execute the program like so:

```
./ModularMadness
```

To compile the test cases suite, run `make tests`

You can execute the test suite by going into the `bin` directory and running ```

```
./tests
```

The test named `example` in the `ModularMadnessTest` test fixture exercises the example provided in the original task specification.

(couldn't run tests as my current office laptop facing some security issues related to c++ plugins)
